## **Introduction**

In this website I will explain what it is, how it works and how to program a 2D particle system in computer graphics. The system will be programmed in C++ using [Visual Studio 2017]( https://www.visualstudio.com/es/downloads/?rr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.es%2F) as IDE, [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) to render the graphics and [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) for data parsing. The end goal of the tutorial is to success on creating a fire and smoke effect.

There are three main things that I wll be focused on for this tutorial:
- **Generic and understandable.** Anyone, regardless of the lanaguage they're using or purpose should be able to understand the concepts and implement his own particle system from the information here presented. The system should be generic enough to be implemented in any project without almost any modification.
- **Good performance.** Particles can really affect framerate and performance so it's important to manage in an optimized way. That's something we will take care of.
- **Well structured, robust and flexible system.** If you have a good structure, building new particle effects on top of it is not very difficult; it's just about adding and tweaking a few parameters. But the base underneath must be solid and work properly. This system should be flexible enough to develop new and more complex features on top of it.

Be aware that this web page is focused on the structure and behaviour of a 2D particle system but it assumes you have a base program loop and can render textures on screen at least. However, we will talk about the render part only for particle effects purposes, not the actual rendering of the texture.

Another important thing that I want to remark is that the way I'm going to explain how to implement the system is not unique and probably not the best. There are a lot of ways to do it and professional people that knows a lot more that I do. If you want to learn more about this topic I encourage you to check the references that helped me doing this.

Well, without further delay let's get into playing with these particles!

## **What is a Particle System and why do we care?**

What is a particle system and why do we need one? Well, first let’s dig a bit into computer graphics stuff.

If you have programmed games or computer graphics related stuff is quite common to work with sprites and sprites sheets. For those unfamiliar with this term, a sprite is simply a two-dimensional bitmap used to be displayed on the screen. It is used especially in 2D videogames to render both static and animated elements of the game. It’s also very frequent to find them as a pixel art form. To save memory they are normally grouped into a same bitmap called sprite sheet. Down below there’s an example of a sprite sheet of Fire Man from the NES Mega Man game:

This example is very simple but sprites can become complex...

...a lot actually...

So, what happens when we need something more organic, more chaotic; like a fire, a smoke, a fog, fireworks, snow… Yes, you’ve guessed it. It has to be drawn by hand by the artist. If the game has a low-res pixel art style it may not be a problem, but as the game becomes more detailed natural elements are more difficult to reproduce and if you have to timeline for your project this is a problem. 

This is a spritesheet of a fire caused by a a bomb in Gunbird (Psiskyo, 1994):

You start to see the problem now right? What if the game is too complex to do it by a hand or is actually a 3D game? Well, that's when particle systems come into play.
