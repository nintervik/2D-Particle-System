## **2D Particle System** 

I am [Víctor Masó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADctor-mas%C3%B3-garcia/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).

### **Introduction**

In this website I will explain what it is, how it works and how to program a 2D Particle System in computer graphics. The system will be programmed in C++ using Visual Studio 2017 as IDE and SDL 2.0 to render the graphics.

There are three main things that I wll be focused on for this tutorial:
- Generic. Anyone, regardless of the lanaguage they're using or purpose should be able to understand the concepts and implement his own particle system from the information here presented.
- Good performance. Particles can really affect framerate and performance so it's important to manage in an optimized way. That's something we will take care of.
- Well structured, robust and flexible system. If you have a good structure, building new particle effects on top of it is not very difficult; it's just about adding and tweaking a few parameters. But the base underneath must be solid and work properly. 

Another important thing that I want to remark is that the way I'm going to explain how to implement the system is not unique and probably not the best. There are a lot of ways to do it and professional people that knows a lot more that I do. If you want to learn more about this topic I encourage you to check the references that helped me doing this.

Well, without further delay let's get into playing with these particles!
